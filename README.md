# HTML & CSS Learning Project

This is my first web development project where I learned the basics of **HTML** and **CSS** by following a YouTube tutorial by [SuperSimpleDev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc).  
Through this project, I practiced building a simple and responsive webpage layout from scratch. After going through the tutorial, I changed the contents of the web page to match my hobbies and interests.

## What I Learned
- Structuring a webpage using semantic HTML  
- Styling layouts with CSS (flexbox, colors, spacing, fonts)  
- Organizing files and linking CSS properly  
- Building a clean, responsive design  

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
